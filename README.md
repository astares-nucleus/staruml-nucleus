### 2. Download and install WhiteStar UML for Windows

and follow the steps to install

#### Installation - Welcome

#### Installation - Setup Type

#### Installation - Installation folder

By default WhiteStarUML installation wizard suggests to install the program into the program folder of your Windows system. 



Unfortunately with this default it is not possible to modify and add files within the WhiteStarUML installation afterwards without specific administrative rights. Therefore we will install the tool into a custom folder - so please ignore this default installation path and install the tool into the following path

```
C:\astares\tools\WhiteStarUML
```
